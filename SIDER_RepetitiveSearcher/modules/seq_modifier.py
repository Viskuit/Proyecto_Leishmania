    2. Then we open the 1000nt_BLASTER file from the 1000nt against each other. To understand it:

       - In the 1000nt file there are "x" number of rows. Each row will be given an index like "Seq_z_LinJ.01_plus", were "z" is the index.
       - So the first row (row[0]) in the 1000nt file will be given "Seq_1.." as a name. And every row with the "Seq_1.." subject in the 1000nt_BLASTER file will the result from the first row in the 1000nt file (row[0]).
       - There will be a maximum of "x" "Seq_x.." in the 1000nt_BLASTER file.

    3. In the 1000nt_BLASTER we search every result from a specific "Seq_z..". And we get the maximum alignment and it's coordinates.
